  Greetings!  Thanks for checking out my portfolio.&nbsp;&nbsp;My name is Jennifer Halvorson & I ventured into the programming world in 2019 after quitting my teaching job in the KC area to move to our family’s southwestern Missouri pecan farm.
  <br><br>
  I created this portfolio using Angular CLI and published <a target="_blank" href="https://paulspecans.com/">Paul’s Pecans</a>, a website dedicated to displaying information about the pecan business my father runs.&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, I am the Quality Assurance Tech, Social Media Marketer, Front End Junior Developer, and Blog Writer for <a target="_blank" href="https://arvidoutdoors.com/">ArvidOutdoors.com</a>, a search engine allowing people to find guided outdoor experiences created & written by my husband, Steve Halvorson.
  <br><br>

  I have built my coding knowledge by participating in development conferences, workshops, & meet-ups and have completed countless lessons & tutorials from online resources.&nbsp;&nbsp;I spend the majority of my time creating small Angular projects and have become highly skilled in research & problem solving (in other words, I am a proficient Googler).<br><br>

  <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/AngularGirls" style="font-weight: normal;">Angular Girls</a> conferences are one of my favorite things to take part in, and recently I was a mentor for the first time for <a target="_blank" style="font-weight: normal;" href="https://workshops.ng-girls.org/ngconf-2021/">ngConf 2021</a>!&nbsp;&nbsp; I am proficient
  with CSS, SASS, HTML, Typescript, Angular, Firebase, Stackblitz, Visual Studio Code,
  Git/GitHub/GitKraken, Weebly, Microsoft Office, Google Suite, and Adobe Creative Cloud. I have
  experience creating icons, logos, brochures, and business cards using Adobe Photoshop.
  <br><br>

  When I'm not coding, you can find me taking pictures of my kids, cat, & backyard birds, watching movies, and reading.&nbsp;&nbsp;I’m usually doing all of this from my kitchen where I seem to constantly cook (and when I’m not cooking, I’m thinking about cooking).<br><br>
