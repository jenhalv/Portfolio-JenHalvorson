  <mat-card-title>About Me</mat-card-title>

  Greetings!  Thanks for checking out my portfolio.  My name is Jennifer Halvorson & I ventured into the programming world in 2019 after quitting my teaching job in the KC area to move to our family pecan farm in southwestern Missouri.<br><br>

  I have built my coding knowledge by participating in development conferences, workshops, & meet-ups and have completed countless lessons & tutorials from online resources.&nbsp;&nbsp;I spend the majority of my time creating small Angular projects and have become highly skilled in research & problem solving (in other words, I am a proficient Googler).<br><br>

  <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/AngularGirls" style="font-weight: normal;">Angular Girls</a> conferences are one of my favorite things to take part in and recently I was a mentor for the first time for <a target="_blank" style="font-weight: normal;" href="https://workshops.ng-girls.org/ngconf-2021/">ngConf 2021</a>!&nbsp;&nbsp;I am familiar with CSS/SASS, HTML, Typescript, Angular, Visual Studio Code, GitHub/GitKraken, Microsoft Office, Google Suite, and Adobe Creative Cloud.<br><br>

  When I'm not coding you can find me taking pictures of my kids, cat, & backyard birds, watching movies, and reading (cookbooks or historical fiction).&nbsp;&nbsp;I’m usually doing all of this from my kitchen where I seem to constantly cook (and when I’m not cooking, I’m thinking about cooking).<br><br>
