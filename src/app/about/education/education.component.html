      I earned my Bachelorâ€™s Degrees in Early Childhood & Elementary Education and General Studies from MSSU, am a certified Library Media Specialist, and received a Master's Degree in Liberal Arts with an emphasis in education from Baker University.
      <br><br>
      My teaching career instilled a passion for learning. In 2018, I ventured into the programming world and am currently busy creating my own portfolio & working on small projects.  I am constantly learning new material from different sources, including Codecademy, freeCodeCamp, Udemy, Pluralsight, and Claim Academy.  I also have participated in Angular (ngGirls & Kansas City Women in Technology) workshops, conferences (KCDC 2019), & local meet-ups.
