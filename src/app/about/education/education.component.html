      Over the past 20 years, I have been a dedicated elementary teacher and substitute. I have Bachelor’s Degrees in General Studies and Early Childhood & Elementary Education. I am also a certified Library Media Specialist and received a Master's Degree in Liberal Arts with an emphasis in education.
      <br><br>
      My teaching career instilled a passion for learning.  I have ventured into the programming world and am busy creating my own portfolio & working on small projects, learning new material via online tutorials & lessons, and getting involved with KC area Angular/coding classes, workshops, conferences, & meet-ups.
