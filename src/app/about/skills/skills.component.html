<!-- THINGS TO ADD LATER:

I have experience with CSS, HTML, Angular, Visual Studio Code, Microsoft Office, Google Suite, and Adobe Creative Cloud. I can type between 70-80 wpm and have experience creating brochures, business cards, documents, and websites. While spending time as a stay-at-home mother, I built a successful home-based photography business <a target="_blank"

<br><br>
Prior to graduating college, I worked part-time in the Career Services office on campus publishing a weekly booklet of job opportunities for graduates. I also worked as a bank courier, a data entry specialist, and an accounting clerk. </mat-card-content>

          Now, who we are looking for:
self-educate
First, you're personable and empathetic. You're skilled and talented, sure, but it's not about you - you want to collaborate, learn and grow, and use your skills for the betterment of the team and our customers.
You're truly passionate about front-end development, not just using it as an entry point to get to the parts of the dev stack that you're more interested in;
You grasp the importance and intricacies of designing and building for responsive/adaptive scenarios;
You understand the deeper workings of a single-page application (we use Angular, but we don't mind if your experience lies in another SPA approach, as long as you're willing to learn);
You have the ability to build complex UI elements from scratch (eg, a graphing component) instead of relying on 3rd party libraries all the time;
You're a fan of design, both visual and experiential, and appreciate the sensibilities it takes to build out a web product that looks, feels and functions as intended;
You have an online portfolio/website that proves the above.
You have dreamed of joining a solid, growing, no nonsense early stage company working directly with founders and A-level experienced players. -->
